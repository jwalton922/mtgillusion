    <h2>Card Relationships</h2>
    We mined thousands of successful tournament decks to find card combos that work.  We put
    together a graph database of those combos so that you can easily discover cards that
    work together well and suggest cards to you based on  your needs.
    
    <h3>Future Plans</h3>
    Import even more decks so we can make better suggestions.  A major improvement we hope
    to add soon is to allow filtering on the suggestions so that, for example,  you could only
    find suggestions that are legal in standard, or that provide creature removal, etc.

    <h2>Proxies!</h2>
    We have full sized card images that allow you to make easy proxies!  Proxy one card, or
    a whole deck, it's up to you.  This allows you to easily play test before you make
    any major purchases.
